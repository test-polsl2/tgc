###TGC—What is it?

Thousands Genome Compressor is a tool to estimate the boundaries of compression ratio for human genome compression. It can be also used as a very effective tool for compression Variant Call Format (VCF) files.

####The architecture of TGC

TGC is composed of several programs that were used in our experiments on the genomes from the 1000 Genomes project. A description of the tool can be found in TGC description.

####How good is TGC?

We were able to compress the genomes from the 1000GP about 15,500 times. More details can be found in our paper pointed below.

####Terms of use of TGC

TGC is in general a free compression program available in source code release.

#### Developers

The TGC algorithm was invented by Sebastian Deorowicz, Szymon Grabowski, and Agnieszka Danek.
The implementation is by [Agnieszka Danek](https://github.com/agnieszkadanek) and Sebastian Deorowicz.
